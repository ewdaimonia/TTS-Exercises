/*EDITED BY GABRIEL SMITH
* DATE: 9/20/19
* DESCRIPTION: This is an app which allows players to play a number guessing game and wager certain amounts of money that they bring to the table.
* This is the main class of that app and it will be initialized and added to an arraylist for each time the game is played.
* Since each game is totally seperate and stored in seperate object variables, they could all be displayed at the end of the session.
* However, this functionality was not implemented as it was not part of the assignment. This class uses the default constructor and has 3 instance
* variables and 9 methods, including the main method.
